## PROJECT OVERVIEW

For this project I had to build an app for a fictional company called "Awesome Startup". The employees are distributed accross the United States and the company wanted a web app to be able to list all the employees and share contact information with each other. 

To build the database we had to use a public API to grab the information for 12 random employees, and use that information to build a prototype for the employee directory web app.
